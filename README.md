# New York Museum Map

This app shows a list of museums, their locations using Google Maps' API and information about these museums using Foursquare's API.

To use, just open `index.html` in your browser.  You'll see a list of markers on a Google map, as well as a list of all locations with a search function on the left of the page.  To find out more information for a museum, click the name of the museum on the list or its marker on the map, which will result in an infowindow popping up that shows information pulled from Foursquare.

If you would like to add more museums, open the `app.js` file in the `js` folder and add more locations to the `locations` array, in the same format as the others.
